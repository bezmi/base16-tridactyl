# base16-tridactyl
Base16 Themes for the firefox [tridactyl](https://github.com/tridactyl/tridactyl) plugin

Two options for installation:

- In Tridactyl, run `:colorscheme --url [URL to raw CSS of theme of your choice] [theme name of your choice]` e.g. `:colorscheme --url https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bezmi/base16-tridactyl/master/base16-bespin.css bespin`

- __Or__ clone this repo and copy themes into your tridactyl themes folder. Use `:help colorscheme` and `:help source` to figure out where to put your themes folder - see the tridactyl FAQ for more info.

The current themes are all based on the shydactyl theme. ~~If you want the default theme with base16 colours, I will get around to it eventually~~.

__This repo is not actively maintained. If updates are needed to work with a new version of tridactyl, make changes, test them and submit a pull request!__
